# 0x01. NoSQL
This directory contains MongoDB command files on how to work with MongoDB. It also contains some Python scripts on how to integrate MongoDB into a Python program. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Concepts
* NoSQL Basics
* MongoDB
* MongoDB Shell
* Aggregation Operators
* PyMongo

## How to run
All MongoDB command files can easily be executed using the syntax

`cat file | mongo`

This will send the contents of the file (assumed to contain valid MongoDB commands) to the `mongodb shell`.

And all Python scripts have been marked as executables and can easily be executed using the syntax:

`./script.py`
